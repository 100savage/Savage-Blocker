 The Savage Blocker is more than just an ad-blocking tool for Debian like Linux systems.
 
   This tool gathers a merged collection of malicious domain lists from various sources,
 including Steven Black, Malwaredomains, and other reputable sources. This tool
 enhances your online experience by protecting your privacy, saving you bandwidth,
 speeding up web browsing, and reducing online nuisances. With The Savage Blocker,
 you can surf the web without being distracted by ads or being tracked by advertisers.
 It also helps protect your privacy by blocking known malicious domains. While no tool
 can block all internet ads, we believe that The Savage Blocker makes your online experience
 a little bit better. 

 You can easily:

 Add any website of your choice to block. The malicious domain list may be insufficient for you.
 Remove a blocked website from the list. You may need to access a reliable website that is blocked.
 Remove all website blocking.
 Exit without making any changes.
 This tool allows you to block websites by category. You can select or deselect any of the
